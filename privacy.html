Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland). Such use includes the 'Universal Analytics' mode of operation. This makes it possible if a user is logged into a Google service, to assign data, sessions, and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus to analyze the user's activities across such devices.</p>

<h3>WEB ANALYTICS</h3>
<p>A.R.T.S uses Google Analytics to measure behavior of users on the website. Google Analytics cookies records data about a user as well as remember user behavior across websites. A unique ID is assigned to users which does not identify personality and is not used to track personal information. It only enables Google to track individual activity and return visits.</p>
<p>If you wish to prevent the collection of data regarding your activity on our website by Google Analytics, you can use Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
